          Pachirisu is a small, white squirrel-like Pokémon with a faint blueish
          tint and a light blue stripe starting from its forehead and goes all
          the way down to the tip of the tail. A female Pachirisu's blue stripe
          is shorter than a male's. A large white tooth grows out of its mouth.
          It has deep gray eyes and a yellow circle on each cheek. Its tail is
          almost twice as big as its body, with three spikes at the top of the
          curl, which it can use to shoot charges. Though its arms and legs are
          very short, it can run incredibly fast, enabling it to tire pursuing
          Pokémon out quickly. It has a great amount of electricity flowing
          within its body. If it builds up enough charge, it may shock other
          Pokémon. It is related to the Pikachu line.
