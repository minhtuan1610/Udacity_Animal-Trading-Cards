          Pachirisu is a small, white squirrel-like Pokémon with a faint blueish
          tint and a light blue stripe starting from its forehead and goes all
          the way down to the tip of the tail. A female Pachirisu's blue stripe
          is shorter than a male's. A large white tooth grows out of its mouth.
          It has deep gray eyes and a yellow circle on each cheek. Its tail is
          almost twice as big as its body, with three spikes at the top of the
          curl, which it can use to shoot charges. Though its arms and legs are
          very short, it can run incredibly fast, enabling it to tire pursuing
          Pokémon out quickly. It has a great amount of electricity flowing
          within its body. If it builds up enough charge, it may shock other
          Pokémon. It is related to the Pikachu line. When it sleeps, Pachirisu
          likes to curl its big, fluffy tail round to the front of its body and
          uses it as a pillow. It also likes to chase and groom its tail. When a
          Pachirisu sheds its fur it shapes them into furballs, which have
          static charges just like its fur. It hides its favorite foods—which
          mainly consist of berries—in these static puffs and stores them in
          tree holes. It does this to protect the food; if a human or another
          Pokémon tries to take the food, they will get shocked from the static.
          It may rub cheek pouches with another Pachirisu to share stored
          electricity. It is generally found in treetops in forests, as well as
          the outskirts of a forest and near power plants.
